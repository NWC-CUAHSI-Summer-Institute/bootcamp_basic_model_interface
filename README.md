# Basic Model Interface
BMI is a simple concept—it’s just a set of functions with rules for the function names, arguments, and returns.

### Example running multiple models
This directory contains three separate models (CFE, Penman and Bucket), all of which include a Basic Model Interface. The example notebook, **run_multiple_bmi_modules.ipynb**, runs through the BMI functions to run these models with a very simple mock-framework.
